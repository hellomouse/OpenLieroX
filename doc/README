	Description
	===========
It's some type of a real-time, excessive clone of Worms.


	About
	=====
OpenLieroX is based on Jason Boettcher's famous Liero Xtreme.
( Take a look here: http://lxalliance.net/lierox/ )
Jason B. has released his work in 2006 under the zlib-licence
and after some months of work, we ported and enhanced his work
and got OpenLieroX.


	Compilation
	===========

Linux/Unix:

There are 2 ways to compile the game. The recommended way is to use CMake. If you cannot use that for some reason (please report them), we have a very simple compile-script which can also be used instead.

In either case, you need to install various dependencies on your system. In the file DEPS, you'll find a list of everything needed. For some of the libraries, we also support to use the builtin version instead in which case you don't need to install the library.

For CMake, you have to install CMake on your system. Then call
	cmake .
(Don't forget the "." at the end.) This will generate the Makefile. There are various options you can change. After that call, you get a list of all variables which can be changed. For example, if you want to have HawkNL builtin, you can set it like this:
	cmake -DHAWKNL_BUILTIN=Yes .
CMake will remember all your settings the next time you call it. You only need to call it again if new source-files were added or deleted from the project or if you want to change an option.

After you have called CMake, you can start the compilation itself with the simple call
	make
If you have multiple CPUs/Cores in your system and you want to speed up the compilation, you can start multiple parallel compiler processes. E.g., if you want to have 4 parallel processes, just type
	make -j4

If you get any errors, search for the first errors in the output. If that is about some missing #include file, you probably forgot to install some of the dependencies. If that is not the case, please report the problem to us (send us the full output of 'make').

Alternativly, if you want to use the compile-script (compile.sh), just call it. Take a look inside for additional options. Basically, you call
	./compile.sh
or, e.g. if you want to have HawkNL support builtin (it would be linked dynamically against otherwise)
	HAWKNL_BUILTIN=1 ./compile.sh

An ongoing forum-thread about compiling OLX under Linux/Unix:
http://lxalliance.net/forum/index.php?topic=5158.0


Mac OS X:

Compiling OLX under MacOSX is only suggested if you want develop on OpenLieroX. In that case, take a look into doc/Development, there is a description about how to compile OLX with Xcode.

There is also a deprecated/unsupported way though, if you have a Fink/Darwinports (or similar) system. In that case, you can partly follow the Unix description above. Remember that this is not the recommended way to compile OLX under MacOSX. Anyway, a long time ago (when I tried it), I was able to compile OLX with this command:

	LIBZIP_BUILTIN=1 HAWKNL_BUILTIN=1 CXXFLAGS="-DMACOSX" \
	LDFLAGS="-framework Cocoa -lSDLmain" ./compile.sh


Windows:

Compiling OLX under Windows is only suggested if you want to develop on OpenLieroX. In that case, take a look into doc/Development, there is a description about how to compile OLX.

There is also a forum-thread about this topic:

	Game search paths
	=================
The game uses case insensitive filenames (it will use the first
found on case sensitive filesystems).
The game searches the paths ~/.OpenLieroX, ./ and /usr/share/OpenLieroX
(or under Gentoo: /usr/share/games/OpenLieroX) for game-data
(all path are relative to this bases) (in this order) by default.
You can also add more searchpathes and change this in cfg/options.cfg.
Own modified configs, screenshots and other stuff always will
be stored in ~/.OpenLieroX.


	Report bugs / feature requests
	==============================
If you find a bug in OpenLieroX, please fill in a bug report! We have a bug tracker for this:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=browse&group_id=180059&atid=891648

If you have a nice idea about a feature or if you just miss something, please fill in a feature request. We have a feature request tracker for this:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=180059&atid=891651

When filling in a bug report, please be precise! Say exactly, what version you are using, what operating system (Windows, MacOSX, Linux) and what version of that you are using. If you are not using the most recent version of OpenLieroX, please try with the newest version if the problem is already fixed there. If you are using a version from SVN, please say exactly what revision that is.

Beside that, for the bug itself, the console output is needed in almost all cases. Just post it or attach it to the bug report. Depending on the operating system, the console output of OpenLieroX is a bit hidden from you.

For Linux/Unix, just call the game via console. You will get all the output there.

For MacOSX, there are multiple ways.

One way of getting the output (also from already running OLX or already exited OLX) is the tool /Applications/Utilities/Console. MacOSX saves the console output of every application and this tool can show them. Specify the filer "openlierox" and you will see all the output.

Another way is similar to Unix, just call it via console (e.g. with the /Applications/Utilities/Terminal application). E.g., if you installed OpenLieroX to /Applications, the full path to call it via console would be:

	/Applications/OpenLieroX.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenLieroX

For Windows, there should be a file stdout.txt in the OpenLieroX directory containing all the output.




	Thanks for all the fish
