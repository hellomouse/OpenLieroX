Directions:
1 Unzip the contents of this zip file into your LieroX directory.
2 Launch LieroX.
3 Start a game
4 Select this mod.
5 Play it. (or don't, it's up to you!)

If you want to use the custom effects that fit with your species, copy the contents of one of the folders from the GFX folder (C:\whatever\LieroX056\WH40K ...\GFX\species) to  Data\GFX (C:\whatever\LieroX056\Data\GFX). This will change the spawning, crosshair and hook graphics. If you want to use the original graphics, use the "Standard" graphics (C:\whatever\LieroX056\WH40K ...\GFX\Standard)

See "List - Weapons.txt" for a description of the weapons.
See "List - Races.txt" for the armament of races.
See "List - Characters.txt" to become a character.
See "History.txt" for changes over time.
See "Readme.txt" for this text (doh!)

Notes:
Use the GFX or SFX as you wish, just don't tell others you made them yourself. I don't need anything for them, but don't feel constrained to send me some cash if you REALLY want to.

If this mod messes up your computer, it isn't my fault.
