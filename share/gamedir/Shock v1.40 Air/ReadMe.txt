Shock v1.40 Beta - 2004-05-02

Mod to Liero Xtreme v0.56b and weapon compiler 0.31b.
By Strider from thegaminguniverse.com

Includes 114 new weapons in adition to the 37 orginal ones, with a total of 148. 5 of the weapons have ideas from the Oddball mod (more to come).
The orginal weapons behave very simular to the orginal Liero but have also enhancements to work and look much better.

Most graphics are made by me, and have double resolution and more colors compared to the orginal ones. I have made them with Paint Shop Pro (PSP). Please ask me if you want to use them, and if I say yes, add me as a contributor in you mod text file.

Just uncompress this "Shock vX.XX" folder inside your LieroX folder, where X.XX is the version number.
Replace all images in the "Shock vX.XX\gfx\Replace" folder in the "LieroX\Data\gfx" folder to get the high resolution versions.
Download my Skin pack for better looking Worms, and use the enhanced sounds for better quality.

I will be very happy to receve suggestions on how to balance the weapons better or if you have ideas on new weapons.

Special thanks to Mistacheese for giving me all his scripts from the Oddball mod (in Shock 1.05 and after).

Note:

A few weapons like: Acid Gas, Builder, Destroyer, Gas Grenade, Smoke Grenade
are not recomanded if you have a slower computer than 1000Mhz.

This mod is play tested with 100% reload time (much faster, or much slower might unballanced it) with 800MHz and 2400MHz.
LieroX v0.56b can have invisible explosion while 0.55b will show them and heal at the same time, so it is not recomanded to use the old version (can even be seen as cheating). LieroX v0.57b functions even better not showing blood when it shoudl not.
